### Does defense really win championships?
```{r}

#create a subset only include "Team","Games","Win.Loss","Off.Rank","Def.Rank"
CFB_sub<-CFB[c("Team","Games","Win.Loss","Off.Rank","Def.Rank","Off.Yards.per.Game")]

#add a colume Win.Game which tells us the team win that game or not
CFB_sub<-CFB_sub %>%
  separate(Win.Loss, c("Win", "Loss"), "-") %>% 
  mutate(Win.Game = case_when(Win>Loss~1, Win<Loss~2, Win==Loss~0))

CFB_sub %>% 
  group_by(Win.Game) %>% 
  summarise(mean(Def.Rank),mean(Off.Yards.per.Game),median(Def.Rank),median(Off.Yards.per.Game))

CFB_sub %>% ggplot(aes(as.factor(Win.Game),Def.Rank))+geom_boxplot(fill="Green")+xlab("Win Game")+ylab("Yards per game they gave up")
